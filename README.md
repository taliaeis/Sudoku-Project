This is the repository for our Sudoku solver program.
The bulk of the code is stored in solver.c.
The Makefile will compile the code.
The .txt files contain sample sudokus for the program to solve.

This is the format that starter files should be in:
First, the size of the sudoku (4 or 9). Then, the values in each cell, going down each column and left to right.
Any cells to be left blank should be represented by a "-" character.
The values should be listed one after the other (no commas or spaces)
